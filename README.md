A curated list of Natural Language Generation papers, tutorials, and blogs.

## Introduction
In the most widely-cited survey of Natural Language Generation methods([Building natural language generation systems](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=qnWQU9C8bDkC&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=building+natural+language+generation+systems&ots=j-2Pds_odB&sig=nnQkzh-X1Y_haxTGECjpHl445xo#v=onepage&q=building%20natural%20language%20generation%20systems&f=false)), Natural Language Generation is characterized as "the subfield of artificial intelligence and computational linguistics that is concerned with the construction of computer systems than can produce understandable texts in English or other human languages from some underlying non-linguistic representation of information". Therefore, the terms "Natural Language Generation" and "NLG" are commonly used to refer to systems that generate text from non-linguistic data. The goal of Natural Language Generation is to generate text that can adequately and fluently describes the given data, which is usually a set of data records like table.
